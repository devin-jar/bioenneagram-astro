This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from https://bioenneagram.com/ (referred to as the "Site").

## PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information."

We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

### COOKIES

A cookie is a file sent to request permission to be stored on your computer. When you accept this file, it's created and the cookie then serves to gather information about web traffic and facilitates future visits to recurring websites. Another function of cookies is that websites can recognize you individually, providing you with the best personalized service.

Our website uses cookies to identify which pages are visited and their frequency. This information is used solely for statistical analysis and is then permanently deleted. You can delete cookies at any time from your computer. However, cookies help provide better website services. They don't access information from your computer or about you unless you choose to provide it directly. You can accept or decline the use of cookies, though most browsers automatically accept cookies as they enable better web services. You can also change your computer settings to decline cookies. If you decline, you may not be able to use some of our services.

## HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We use the Order Information we collect generally to fulfill orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging shipping, and providing invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:
- Communicate with you;
- Screen orders for potential risk or fraud; and
- When aligned with preferences you've shared with us, provide information or advertising related to our products or services.

We use the Device Information we collect to help identify potential risks and fraud (particularly your IP address) and to generally improve and optimize our Site (e.g., by generating analytics about how customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of marketing and advertising campaigns).

## SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information as described above. For example, we use Google Analytics to understand how customers use the Site. You can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.

Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other lawful request for information we receive, or to protect our rights.
